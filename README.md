# PathProduct ✈

PathProduct is a new platform that connects travelers and buyers from around the world. The platform allows buyers to post requests for products and connect with travelers who are already planning trips to their area. By cutting out the middleman, it offers a faster and more cost-effective way to get the products you need.

For now, there is only an admin demo that monitors the posts. You can upload a new post, edit an existing post, or delete a post. I am currently working on implementing more features and functionalities to make the platform even better.

## Technologies:
* React.js
* mockAPI
* Styled Components
* Axios
* React Router Dom
